Description: A set of fast and convenient functions to calculate multiple 
             transport accessibility measures. Given a pre-computed travel cost 
             matrix in long format combined with land-use  data (e.g. location 
             of  jobs, healthcare, population), the package  allows one to 
             calculate active and passive accessibility levels using multiple 
             accessibility metrics such as: cumulative opportunity measure 
             (using either travel time cutoff or interval), minimum travel cost 
             to closest N number of activities, gravitational measures and 
             different floating catchment area methods.
