#' @param group_by A `character` vector. When not `character(0)` (the default),
#'   indicates the `accessibility_data` columns that should be used to group the
#'   inequality estimates by. For example, if `accessibility_data` includes a
#'   `departure_time` column that specifies the departure time that each entry
#'   refers to, passing `"departure_time"` to this parameter results in
#'   inequality estimates grouped by departure time.
