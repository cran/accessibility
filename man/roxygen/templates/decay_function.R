#' @param decay_function A `fuction` that converts travel cost (t_ij) into an
#'   impedance factor used to weight opportunities. For convenience, the package
#'    currently includes the following functions: \code{decay_bineary},
#'    \code{decay_exponential}, \code{decay_exponential} and \code{decay_power}.
#'    See the documentation of each decay function for more details.
